# PopularMovies

Project Overview:
The PopularMovies app allows users to discover the most popular movies playing. 
The app uses API from the themoviedb.org to fetch data.

Instructions:
In order for the app to work, an API key is required.
Once  the key is obtained, replace the value of string “api_key” in  PopularMovies/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml 

How to obtain the API key:
If you don’t already have an account with https://www.themoviedb.org, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.

After creating an account, request for a key. The key will be sent via email shortly after. 
It will also be available in the account settings menu.
